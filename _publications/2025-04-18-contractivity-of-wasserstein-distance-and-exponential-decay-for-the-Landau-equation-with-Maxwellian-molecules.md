We consider the Landau equation with Maxwell molecules and show two results: exponential decay of the relative L2 norm and contractivity of the 2-Wasserstein distance of two arbitrary solutions. The proof of the decay of the relative L2 uses a careful analysis of the operator and weighted Poincaré inequalities. Using the framework recently introduced by Guillen and Silvestre in \cite{GS24}, we provide a new, short, intuitive and quantitative proof that the Landau equation is contractive in the 2-Wasserstein metric. To achieve this, we quantify the convexity of the 2-Wasserstein distance.

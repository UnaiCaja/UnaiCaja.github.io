I have always felt passionate about research. Over the years, my interests have concentrated in applied mathematics. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Murcia (Spain), finished a Master in the Autonomous University of Madrid (Spain) and moved to Austin (Texas, US) to pursue a PhD, which is my current occupation.

At the moment, my interests are focussed on the study of partial differential equations (PDEs) arising from physics. Particularly, I am researching the interplay between kinetic equations and optimal transport theory under the supervision of [Maria Gualdani](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/gualdani/) and [Matias Delgadino](https://zaytam.github.io/).

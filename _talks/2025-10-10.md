In recent work, Guillen–Silvestre showed that Fisher information decreases along solutions to the homogeneous Landau equation. This raises a natural question: are there other functionals that exhibit similar monotonicity or boundedness properties? In this talk, we study the behavior of the 2‑Wasserstein distance, a natural candidate for such a functional. Using the symmetrization technique introduced by Guillen–Silvestre, we establish a new analytic proof of contractive estimates originally obtained by Fournier and Guérin via stochastic methods.
 
This is joint work with Matias Delgadino, Maria Gualdani and Maja Taskovic.
